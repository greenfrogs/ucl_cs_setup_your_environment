# Python 3
> Python is an experiment in how much freedom programmers need. Too much freedom and nobody can read another's code; 
>too little and expressiveness is endangered. -- *Guido van Rossum*

We only use Python 3 at UCL because it’s 2019 and Python 2 is long lost in the past, thank goodness.

1. Download the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), when offered it is a good idea to add
it to your path.

2. Open the Jetbrains Toolbox and install PyCharm Professional, once opened it should automatically find your Python
environment.
